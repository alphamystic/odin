  * Does recon on a particular target returning

    2. Find Any other Alternative IP Address (Checkk if it's associated with an IP or they are already in place)
    3. Services running
        For each subd and alternate IP check for the services running and open ports
          {IP:{SERVICES/PORT}} //also check for iot/scada systems
    4. Try findning the vulnerabilities available and the payloads to be used >> Send to classifier to do this

// taking every aaddress as a subdomain, the recon therefore has a rocess of:
  1.Get the target.
  2. Check if it's a domain or IP
  3. If it's an IP, get the recon data straight, if not?
  4. Use  (You can create a Host,AssociateIP struct to assist in data handling)
      1. Use host -d to find the IP associate thn check for firewall presence(if cloud flare ignore it) check for IPv4 or IPv6
      2. Find alternate subdomains and their IP associates
      3. Use theHarvester to find alternate IPs andemails
      4. Use google dorks to find more data on target
  ## DO RECON
  5. Check for firewall presence in each.
  6. Scan for open ports and services
  ## Now we should know the service version and scan for CVE's
  7. If web service, check for CMS,directories,parameters,cgi
  If others, sent to rico for bruteforce
  The neural net should enumerate all the remaining services like smb,ad and find an exploit to create another way in
      this can be directory mounting,DNS,NFS,SMTP,SNMP,RDP,SSH,FTP,Responder for hashes and NTLM

    *In a way this has skipper written all over it but only time will answer it*
