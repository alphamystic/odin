  Wrote the original source code for ODIN and WHEAGLE giving it the baseline. Some code may be changed with time especially zoo might be given it's own library to support all possible operating systems.
  1. WHEAGLE: Commandline to interact with implants and C2's
  2. WHEAGLE and ODIN: Session manager to manage C2's and minions with their worker pools.
  3. ODIN: Fixed the bug causing it not to scan for open ports but just hang.( I actually have't done this just placing it here so that someone does it or someone fixes another bug.)
  4. Wrote Unit tests for a file abcd. (I have written none guys :)
  5. Showed us what proper documentatiion looks like. (No he did not :) do this too.)
  6. Added contributors to the list. (This guy, trash emoji).
(Basically something like this when you do a commit of your work.)
